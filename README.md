# Kenzies-Trivia-Game

My girlfriend loves trivia, so to get additional practice with utilizing local storage and creating fetch requests from API's;
I found an open source Trivia API online @ https://opentdb.com/ and created a simple app that will display the information on the page along with grabbing a random question from opentdb's api 

## in this project

  1. All the information is populated from opentdb.
  2. The users amount of questions that they have submitted is logged along with how many questions they got right.
  3. A percentage is also show to reflect the users accuracy while playing. 
  4. A clear data has been provided which wipes the local storage and refreshes the page; this is tied to an if statment which resets the variables to 0.
  5. If a submission is incorrect; the correct answer is console logged if you are curious as to what the correct answer was.

## API links

All the information; the questions and, answers are retrieved via a get request from https://opentdb.com/
